          The Tories were members of two political parties which
          existed sequentially in the Kingdom of England, the
          Kingdom of Great Britain and later the United Kingdom of
          Great Britain and Ireland from the 17th to the early 19th
          centuries. The first Tories emerged in 1678 in England,
          when they opposed the Whig-supported Exclusion Bill which
          set out to disinherit the heir presumptive James, Duke of York,
          who eventually became James II of England and VII of Scotland.
